### Insights from EDA impacting business:

The most selling and crowded store type is A.
More stores are opened during School holidays than State holidays.
Mondays have most sales since most of the Sundays are closed.
Promo 1 has given positive yields where as Promo 2 is a disaster.
Store type b has higher sales and customers per store than other store types.
Assortment b is available only at store type b and it has more sales and customers than any other assortment.
Suggestions provided to increase the Sales:

There are very few B type stores, few more can be opened as average sales are quite high as compared to other types.
Assortment B is only available with store type B which can be extended to other types as well to cater the demands of customers.
Promo 2 should be discontinued and Promo 1 can be extended futher as it shows better results.
Very few stores are opened during State Holidays, so it suggested to open a subsequent amount of stores to serve in emergency purposes.
